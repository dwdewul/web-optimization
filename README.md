# Website Performance Optimization Portfolio Project

## How to run:
Simply open up ```index.html``` in your favorite browser!

## Optimizations made:
* I replaced ```querySelector``` and ```querySelectorAll``` with ```getElementById``` and ```getElementsByClassName``` for a slight performance boost
* I removed DOM queries from ```for``` loops to avoid overhead
* I compressed the pizzeria image in ```index.html```
* I inlined my CSS to avoid render-blocking
